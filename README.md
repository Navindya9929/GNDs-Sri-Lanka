# GNDs-Sri-Lanka
A map of Grama Niladari Divisions (GNDs) in Sri Lanka is an invaluable educational resource, offering a detailed view of the administrative subdivisions that form the backbone of local governance in the country. This map delineates the smallest administrative units, each managed by a Grama Niladari, or village officer, who plays a key role in local administration and community development. By examining this map, students and researchers can better understand the structure of Sri Lanka's administrative system, the distribution of resources, and the local governance mechanisms that support rural and urban communities. Additionally, it provides insights into demographic distribution, regional planning, and the interaction between local and central government, thereby enhancing one's comprehension of both administrative geography and the practical aspects of civic management.
